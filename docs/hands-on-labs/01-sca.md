# Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

Lacework FortiCNAPP's **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** scans your project‚Äôs dependencies for **known vulnerabilities**, comparing them against trusted vulnerability databases. SCA also links out to third-party CVE descriptions, helping developers and security teams take informed action quickly.

!!! tip "Shift Left with SCA"
    Lacework SCA is designed to be run early in the SDLC‚Äîduring local development or CI/CD‚Äîto reduce risk before vulnerabilities reach production.

---

## Supported Languages & Package Managers

Lacework FortiCNAPP SCA currently supports the following languages and associated file types:

| **Language** | **Package Manager / File Type**               |

| Lacework (default) | `lw-json`        |
| GitLab          | `gitlab-json`        |

---

### Generating SBOM's

FortiCNAPP supports generating Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) in standard formats like CycloneDX, SPDX, SARIF, and more.

!!! tip
    For a full walkthrough on generating SBOMs from CLI, see the [Hands-On Labs ‚Üí SBOM Generation](01-sca.md#sbom-generation)

### Use Cases

- ‚úÖ Detect open-source vulnerabilities early in development.
- ‚úÖ Block high-severity CVEs in CI/CD pipelines.
- ‚úÖ Export SBOMs for compliance or vendor risk audits.

---

## License Compliance

Lacework FortiCNAPP‚Äôs **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** includes built-in **license detection and compliance validation**. It scans third-party packages in your projects and identifies their associated licenses‚Äîclassifying them by risk using Google's license classifier.

!!! important "Why It Matters"
    License compliance is critical for organizations that need to meet internal software policies, open-source usage rules, or external audit requirements.

---

### License Categories

Lacework classifies licenses into categories based on usage rights and restrictions. These categories are derived from Google‚Äôs [license classifier](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/using-the-license-checker).

#### Forbidden

Licenses that **cannot be used** due to legal or policy restrictions.

!!! danger "Forbidden"
    Includes:
    `AGPL-3.0`

#### Restricted

Licenses that **require source distribution** or impose redistribution constraints.

!!! warning "Restricted"
    Includes:
    `GPL-2.0`, `GPL-3.0`, `LGPL-2.1`, `Sleepycat`, `CC-BY-NC-*`, `Facebook-*`

#### Reciprocal

Can be used freely **in unmodified form**, but may require derivative works to be open-sourced.

!!! example "Reciprocal"
    Includes:
    `EPL-1.0`, `CDDL-1.0`, `APSL-*`, `MPL-*`, `IPL-1.0`

#### Notice

Permissive licenses that allow redistribution and modification with attribution.

!!! note "Notice"
    Includes:
    `MIT`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `Apache-2.0`, `Zlib`, `Python-2.0`, `PHP-3.01`

#### Unencumbered

Free to use **without significant restriction**.

!!! success "Unencumbered"
    Includes:
    `Unlicense`, `CC0-1.0`, `ZeroBSD`

#### Other

- **permissive (uncommon)** ‚Äì Minimal conditions, rare usage
- **unknown** ‚Äì Undetermined license
- **custom** ‚Äì Manually defined or non-standard license

---

## License Compliance Configuration

You can enforce license compliance by defining your own policy rules using YAML.

!!! note
    For full instructions on creating and applying license policies, see the [Hands-On Labs ‚Üí License Compliance](01-sca.md#configuring-license-compliance-policies).

### License Scanning Output

SCA license scanning results include:

- üìú **License name** per package
- üîí **Category** (e.g. forbidden, reciprocal)
- ‚úÖ **Confidence score** on accuracy

---

### Best Practices

- üîç Audit dependencies regularly for restricted or unknown licenses
- ‚öôÔ∏è Integrate license policy config with version control
- üß™ Use CI/CD scans to block merges with non-compliant licenses

---

## SmartFix

**SmartFix** is Lacework FortiCNAPP's intelligent recommendation engine for resolving vulnerabilities detected during Software Composition Analysis (SCA). It delivers **actionable**, **conflict-free**, and **optimized** fixes directly within your development tools and workflows.

---

### Where SmartFix is Available

SmartFix is automatically enabled and integrated into the following environments:

- ‚úÖ **Lacework FortiCNAPP UI** (via the SCA findings panel)
- ‚úÖ **SCM integrations** (e.g., GitHub PR comments)
- ‚úÖ **Lacework CLI scans**

!!! tip
    SmartFix runs automatically during SCA scans and does not require separate activation or configuration.

---

### Key Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unified Fix Suggestions**| Recommends a single package version to resolve **multiple CVEs at once**.   |
| **Conflict Resolution**    | Avoids conflicting upgrades from multiple vulnerabilities.                  |
| **Context-Aware Upgrades** | Considers CVE severity and package stability in recommendations.            |

---

### How SmartFix Works

SmartFix analyzes vulnerable packages and evaluates future versions to determine the best upgrade path using a prioritized strategy:

#### Recommendation Algorithms

1. **Minimal Version with No Vulnerabilities**  
    Smallest upgrade that fixes **all** known vulnerabilities.

1. **Minimal Version with No Critical Vulnerabilities**  
    Fixes critical CVEs while minimizing version drift.

1. **Maximal Version with No Vulnerabilities**  
    Latest version that resolves all issues.

1. **No SmartFix Recommendation**  
    Returned when no safe upgrade path exists.

!!! info "Prioritization Order"
    SmartFix evaluates upgrade options in this order:

    1. Minimal version with no vulnerabilities  
    2. Minimal version with no *critical* vulnerabilities  
    3. Maximal version with no vulnerabilities  
    4. No SmartFix recommendation (explicitly stated if no fix meets criteria)

---

### Real-World Example

!!! example "Log4J Case"
    In early Log4J incidents, initial fixes introduced new CVEs.  
    SmartFix would recommend a version that **resolved the initial CVE** *and* **avoided introducing new ones**, improving fix quality and reducing rework.

---

### Benefits of SmartFix

| Benefit               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Saves Time**        | Resolves multiple issues with one upgrade.                                  |
| **Reduces Risk**      | Avoids introducing new vulnerabilities.                                     |
| **Simplifies Choices**| Prevents conflicting or redundant recommendations.                          |

---

### Using SmartFix

No special configuration is required. SmartFix is:

- üîÅ **Enabled by default**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Executed with every SCA scan**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Displayed in:**
  - **UI**: Shown in the *Fix Version* column beside NVD fixes
  - **CLI**: Included in scan output files
  - **IDE**: Highlighted in code as suggestions
  - **SCM PRs**: Auto-commented on pull requests with inline fix advice

SmartFix is available in multiple developer-facing environments to provide remediation guidance where it's needed most:

??? note "üíª IDE Extensions"
    SmartFix recommendations can be accessed directly within supported Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), enabling developers to address vulnerabilities as they code.

    ![SmartFix in IDE](images/ide.png)

??? note "üîÑ Pull Request Comments"
    As part of Lacework's SCM integration, SmartFix automatically generates comments on pull requests, providing actionable recommendations for resolving vulnerabilities before code is merged.

    ![SmartFix in PR](images/pr.png)

---

## Hands-On

This guided section helps you generate a vulnerable project, scan it, and see SmartFix in action using GitHub and VS Code.

---

### Step 1: Create a New Project from the Template

```bash
gh repo create lab_forticnapp_code_security --template 40docs/lab_forticnapp_code_security --public
cd lab_forticnapp_code_security
```

---

### Step 2: Open in VSCode

![Start Scan](images/vscode4.png){align=left width=325}

1. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. If not installed and configured as a part of `Prerequisites` then please follow the steps in: [Prerequisites](00-prerequisites.md#required-tools) in `Configure the Lacework VSCode Extension`
3. Run a scan using one of the options:

   - **Start All Scans**
   - **Start SCA Scan**

!!! tip
    The extension highlights issues inline, including SmartFix recommendations where available.

---

### Step 3: Trigger a SmartFix via GitHub PR

To see SmartFix in GitHub:

!!! note "Trigger a Scan"

    ![Lacework_Bot](images/github1.PNG){align=left width=325}

    A Pull Request to the repo triggers a SCA scan automatically, within minutes a comment will be added to the PR.

    ```bash
    echo "paramiko==2.4.1" >> app/requirements.txt && \
    git checkout -b trigger-smartfix && \
    git add app/requirements.txt && \
    git commit -m "Add vulnerable dep to trigger SmartFix" && \
    git push -u origin trigger-smartfix && \
    gh pr create --fill
    ```
---

!!! note "GitHub CLI Required"
    - Ensure [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is installed and authenticated to use `gh pr create`.

    - This opens a pull request that triggers FortiCNAPP scanning and displays SmartFix suggestions as inline PR comments or in the Lacework UI. **Note** that the SmartFix recommendations are solely for new vulnerabilities that are introduced as a result of that PR, and not inclusive of all vulnerabilities within the `Files changed`.

---

### Step 4: View and Apply Fixes

1. Open the PR on GitHub
2. Review SCA findings and SmartFix suggestions
3. Optionally apply fixes manually or inline in the IDE

---

### SBOM Generation

!!! example "Generate an SBOM for your project"

    === "Command"
    
        ```bash
        lacework sca scan ./ -o scan_results.json
        ```
    
    === "Flags"
    
        * `-o`: Specifies the output file name and path.
        * `-f` / `--formats`: Specifies the format of the SBOM (default is `lw-json`).

!!! warning "Required Format for SBOM Analysis"
    To analyze the SBOM later using `lacework sca sbom`, you **must generate it in the default `lw-json` format**:

    ```bash
    lacework sca scan ./ -o scan_results.json
    ```

SBOMs in other formats (e.g., `cdx-json`, `spdx-json`) **will not work** with the `sca sbom` command.

---

To parse through your scan results and extract just the SBOM:

```bash
lacework sca sbom scan_results.json -o sbom.json
```

Your `sbom.json` will contain only the SBOM data.

---

### Configuring License Compliance Policies

Lacework SCA uses a YAML configuration file to enforce license restrictions.

#### File Path

```txt
~/.config/lacework/components/sca/.lacework/sca.config.yaml
```

#### Example Config

```yaml
environments:
  - name: default
    licenses-not-allowed: []
    license-categories-not-allowed: [forbidden, restricted]
```

!!! tip "Customizing License Policies"
    - Use `licenses-not-allowed` to block specific license names (e.g., `"GPL-3.0"`).
    - Use `license-categories-not-allowed` to block entire groups like `"forbidden"` or `"restricted"`.

---

### Scanning with License Enforcement

To evaluate a previously generated SBOM against your license policies:

```bash
lacework sca sbom sbom.json
```

#### Notes

* This command only works with files generated using the `lw-json` format from `lacework sca scan`.
* It applies any license compliance settings found in `.lacework/sca.config.yaml`.

---

### Optional: Export to Other SBOM Formats

If you're using other tools that require standard SBOM formats like CycloneDX or SPDX, you can generate them like this:

=== "Command"

    ```bash
    lacework sca scan ./ -f cdx-json -o sbom.json
    ```

=== "Flags"

    * `-f cdx-json`: Specifies the output format (e.g., CycloneDX JSON).
    * `-o sbom.json`: Specifies the SBOM output file.

!!! info "External Use Only"
    SBOMs in formats like `cdx-json`, `spdx-json`, or `sarif` are intended for use with external tools.
    These **cannot be used with `lacework sca sbom`** for license policy enforcement.
